# Heart Disease Classification

This is a simple heart disease classification project using Python and machine learning.

## Project Description

he project loads a heart disease dataset, preprocesses the data, splits it into training and testing sets, trains a model using the Random Forest Classifier algorithm, and evaluates the modelâ€™s performance.
It is designed as a beginner-friendly example for understanding supervised machine learning.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed (preferably version 3.8 or higher).  
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv heart
   source heart/bin/activate      # On Linux/Mac
   .\heart\Scripts\activate       # On Windows PowerShell

3. Install the required libraries: pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Files :
 a- data/heart-disease.csv: Dataset used for the project.
 b- Simple-ML heart.ipynb :  code files.
 c- requirements.txt: List of required Python libraries.
